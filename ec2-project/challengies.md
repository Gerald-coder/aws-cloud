# **: CHALLENGIES I FACED **

# connecting with EC2 Instance Connect

i was unable to connect at first. then i check my security group and found out i have ssh access from only my ip address. and i already switched to a new network since after creating the security group. meaning there is a higher chance my ip address must i have changed

# solution

i had to update update the security group to my current ip address and it worked just fine
