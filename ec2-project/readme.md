# Task 3: Explore Instance Types

## Overview

AWS offers various EC2 instance families optimized for different workloads. Understanding these families helps in selecting the most efficient and cost-effective option for a given use case.

## Comparison of Instance Families

### 1. Memory Optimized Instances (e.g., `r6g`)

Memory Optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.  
They are ideal for:

- In-memory databases (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
- Real-time big data analytics
- High-performance computing (HPC) that requires large memory capacity

### 2. GPU Optimized Instances (e.g., `p4`, `g5`)

GPU Optimized instances come equipped with powerful NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate compute-intensive tasks.  
They are best suited for:

- Machine learning and deep learning model training
- High-performance computing (HPC) simulations
- 3D rendering and video processing workloads

## Conclusion

By choosing the right instance family, users can achieve the best balance between **cost and performance** based on the specific workload characteristics.
